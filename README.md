# Datamining-Proj
Data mining Project for the Spring semester 2017.
[Debarghya Nandi, Arup Kumar Mondal, Carrie Carlton]

A java based gui implementation of the basic data mining algorithms, (pre processing,discretization,decision tree, naive bayes, knn classification)
We used weka jar for the algorithms,java fx for the gui part and a css stylesheet. We were able to make a comparison of the different classification algorithms, 
with the help of graphs.
